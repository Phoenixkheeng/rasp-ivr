## Welcome to RaspIVR

Rasp-IVR a low cost system based on [Rasperry Asterisk](http://www.raspberry-asterisk.org/) to create low cost IVR systems. It works with supported [modems](http://asterisk-service.com/en_US/page/chan-dongle-modems) and our APIs can be used to setup common IVR scenarios. We are working on this page, please watch this repository for updates.

### Modems
* I suggest you try to find supported modems in local hardware store [modems](http://asterisk-service.com/en_US/page/chan-dongle-modems) 
* If that does not work, you can buy an unlocked one on Ebay

#### Modem (ebay)
Search for **"unlocked chan dongle"** on eBay, it should help you find modems compatible with Asterisk and RasPIvr  

If I remember correctly, I bought this
